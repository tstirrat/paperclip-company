## Getting Started

```bash
npx paperclipai company import this-github-url-or-folder
```

See [Paperclip](https://paperclip.ing) for more information.

## Runtime Configuration

After importing this company into Paperclip, configure heartbeat triggers in the UI:

| Agent | Timer Heartbeat | Wake on Assignment | Wake on Mention |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Heartbeat Dispatcher | ✅ ON (every 5 min) | optional | optional |
| CEO | ❌ OFF | ✅ ON | ✅ ON |
| CTO | ❌ OFF | ✅ ON | ✅ ON |
| Staff Engineer | ❌ OFF | ✅ ON | ✅ ON |
| QA & Release Lead | ❌ OFF | ✅ ON | ✅ ON |
| Research & Perf Analyst | ❌ OFF | ✅ ON | ✅ ON |

**Why:** Timer heartbeats on idle agents burn 2–5K tokens per empty wake. The
Heartbeat Dispatcher is the only agent that needs a timer — it scans for stalled
work and nudges agents only when there's something to push. All other agents
wake only when there's actual work for them.
